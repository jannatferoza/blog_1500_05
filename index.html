            <p>This article covers how far human society is from lab-grown organs, and all that has gone into its development. A large issue with creating organs has to do with structure.
               If cells don't have structure and architecture, they cannot get nurtrients and therefore cannot survive. The final goal of all of this is to make
                human organ donation something of the past, getting rid of issues like not having perfect matches in donated organs since the technology grows organs from the patients
                own stem cells--therefore a perfect match.

            <p>This article goes into depth on the research developed to create a technique that could 
                help in the progress towards functional, lab-grown organs. University of Washington
                scientists took a step towards the goal of lab-grown organs when they devised a method to modify 
                naturally occuring biological polymers with protein-based biochemical messages that affect cell behavioir.
                Using a near-infared laser, they trigger chemical adhesion of protein messages to a structure 
                made from biological polymers such as collagen. These methods could create the foundation of biologically based
                scaffolds that might one day make usable lab-grown tissues possible.

            <p>This article talks about how during the coming weeks of August 25th, 2022, a volunteer in Boston, Massachusettes will
                be the first to trial a new treatment that could end up creating a second liver in their body.
                That is just the start as well. Other volunteers soon will test doses that could
                leave them with up to six livers in their bodies! LyGenesis is the company running this
                treatment and they hope to save people with devastating liver diseases who are not eligible
                for transplants. Their method is to inject liver cells from a donor into the lymph nodes of
                the sick recipients, which can give rise to brand new miniture organs, which can compensate for 
                a currently diseased one. It has worked so far in mice, pigs and dogs--and now they are finding out if 
                it can work in people too.
