            <p>This article covers how far human society is from lab-grown organs, and all that has gone into its development. A large issue with creating organs has to do with structure.
               If cells don't have structure and architecture, they cannot get nurtrients and therefore cannot survive. The final goal of all of this is to make
                human organ donation something of the past, getting rid of issues like not having perfect matches in donated organs since the technology grows organs from the patients
                own stem cells--therefore a perfect match.
